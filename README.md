###**Group Members:**
	Emre Özdemir & Yigit Can Dündar

###**Important Note:**
	If the game will be played through the Unity Project Editor: The game will only work if the play session starts from the first scene,
	which is called "Title Scene". If the play session starts from the "Wave 1 - House", exceptions will be thrown. This behaviour is 
	intended and if the game starts from the correct scene no problems should occur.

###**Controls:**
	
	W,A,S,D - Movement
	Space - Jump, Skip cutscenes
	E,R - Interact with certain objects
	Left Mouse Button - Pick up money, interact with the phone
	Right Mouse Button - Drop held money or item
	Hold Left Mouse Button - Drag and drop certain objects
	ESC - Open/Close Pause Menu
	TAB - Open/Close Asset Menu
	F2 - Enable A.I. representative FOV renderer
	F10 - Previous Track
	F11 - Play/Stop Track
	F12 - Next Track

###**Gameplay:**
		Hide the money until the time runs out. After the timer ends, the Official will come to your house.
		And based on the player's attention level, he will inspect the house. If he finds any money lying around your house
		its game over.
    
	    Notes:
    	-Wave timers are usually larger than what the player would need. So it is possible to end the wave by interacting with
    	the phone inside the living room.
    	-The game automatically saves your progress at the beginning of each wave.
	-The cutscenes can be skipped by hitting the "Space" button.
